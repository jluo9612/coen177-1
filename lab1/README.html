<p>Each file with name in a format of "lab1_#.c" corresponds to each programming task with the same number, with compiled executables having the same name without an extension. "makefile" is a valid makefile that can be used with <code>make</code> to compile every file .</p>
<h2>File list</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>helloworld.c</code>: A simple program printing out some string.</li>
<li><code>lab1_1.c</code>: (Task 1) Simple shell that can be used to run another program (e.g. <code>helloworld</code>) in a new thread.</li>
<li><code>lab1_2.c</code>: (Task 2) Create a linear chain of 8 processes and print out PID and PPID of each process.</li>
<li><code>lab1_3.c</code>: (Task 3) Create a symmetric process tree with 12 children (not counting the root). The tree has 3 levels and each node has exactly 3 children.</li>
<li><code>lab1_4.c</code>: (Task 4) Create a process tree with 17 children. The procedure is 1) create left and right children manually, 2) create tree with 2 levels and 3 children per node (4 nodes) on the first child, 3) create tree with 3 levels and 3 children per node (13 nodes) on the second child.</li>
<li><code>makefile</code>: for compiling</li>
<li>Other executables</li>
</ul>
