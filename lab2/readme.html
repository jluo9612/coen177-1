<h1>COEN 177 Lab 2</h1>
<p><em>Oras Phongpanangam</em></p>
<p>Made changes to Minix kernel source code to produce the following effects</p>
<ol>
<li>Add custom text ("...edited by Oras...") to the start up banner text when booting</li>
<li>Add randomness to process selection process to make booting slower (~7 seconds -&gt; ~1 minute)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Changed Files</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>main.c</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Added some text to <code>announce()</code> function which prints the banner text when booting.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>proc.c</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Inside the function <code>pick_proc()</code>, added these code inside the for-loop iterating over queues (q):</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">rand_num = rand();
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (q &gt; <span class="hljs-number">5</span> &amp;&amp; rand_num &lt; <span class="hljs-number">16000</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">continue</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>That is, if we are considering priority of greater than 5, and if generated random number is less than 16000 (about 50% chance), we defer this priority level and attempt to get a process with less priority. So we have this probability distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>50% chance that we defer level 6</li>
<li>25% chance that we defer level 7 as well</li>
<li>12.5% chance that we defer level 8 as well</li>
<li>...and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>So processes with higher priority will have higher chance to be run, but processes with low priority may be selected as well. The result is that the boot time increases from ~7 seconds to ~1 minute.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Simply booting up the modified Minix system will produce all the desired effects (modified banner, increased boot time).</p>
