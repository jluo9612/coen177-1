<p>Compare performance of disk reading between reading sequentially and jumping all over the file.</p>
<h2>Files</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>seqread.c</code>: Program for reading sequentially.</li>
<li><code>randread.c</code>: Program for reading randomly (jumping all over the file). Also check for the file size and read roughly the same amount of data as <code>seqread</code>.</li>
<li><code>makefile</code>: For compiling.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>After compiling the programs into executables, run the executable and pass the path to the file to read as a command line argument.</p>
<p>Ex: <code>./seqread /local/weka/random5G</code></p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>Within the same method of reading (sequential and random), the time it takes to read the file is roughly proportional to the file's size. Also, reading randomly takes ~94-108 times longer than the sequential case. Clearly, it is a very bad idea to change the file cursor multiple times while reading. Note that the I ran <code>randread</code> on 5G file at about 10 pm separate from other experiments, so the performance seems to be a bit better than other cases.</p>
